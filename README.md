## Features
snippets with nice defaults that are definitely going to save your a lot of time.

Support for the great [package](https://github.com/eddorre/SublimeERB) by [@eddorre](https://github.com/eddorre/):

![demo](http://cl.ly/image/1P2E1x0h210l/toggle_erb.gif)

Toggle with:  <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>></kbd>

(In american keyboard: <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd>)

## Conventions
The conventions for the snippets are usually the initials for the method.

Examples:
* For `validates_presence_of` is `vpo`
* For `has_and_belongs_to_many` is `habtm`
* For `<%= link_to 'hi', path %>` is `lt` and so on.

Also if the method has an optional block like `content_tag` (snippet is `ct`), its block it's going to be adding `block` to the shortcut, in this case `ctblock`

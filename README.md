# rails-snippets package
An [Atom](https://atom.io) package to add snippets for ruby on rails projects, contributions are greatly appreciated, if your favorite snippets are missing [open an issue](https://github.com/joseramonc/railsteroids/issues) or send a pull request, I would :heart: to merge your favorite snippets.

Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add / improve snippets.

## Conventions
The conventions for the snippets are usually the initials for the method.

Examples:
* For `validates_presence_of` is `vpo`
* For `has_and_belongs_to_many` is `habtm`
* For `<%= link_to 'hi', path %>` is `lt` and so on.

Also if the method has an optional block like `content_tag` (snippet is `ct`), its block it's going to be adding `block` to the shortcut, in this case `ctblock`
